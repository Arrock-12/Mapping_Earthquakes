# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
To create a visually appealing and interactive map using GeoJson data, Leaflet, and Mapbox to show earthquake data from the past seven days. GeoJson data was read into a JavaScript code and then plotted onto maps using leaflet and Mapbox. Three overlays were added showing all earthquakes from the past week, major earthquakes from the past week, and tectonic plates. In addition, users can choose to use one of three basemaps to view the data. Popups were included that show the magnitude and location of the earthquake. A formula was applied to the magnitude of the earthquakes to determine a circle radius -- the larger the circle, the higher the magnitude. In additon, a legend was included to help views easily identify magnitudes as each circleMarker was color coded based on the magnitude.

To confirm the code was being read in correctly, console.log was used to view the data.

In this image you can see that there are three basemaps and three overlap options.
